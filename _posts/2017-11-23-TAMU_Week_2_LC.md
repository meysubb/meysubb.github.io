Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Hope you are stuffing yourself with Turkey or whatever it is you chose to eat! I'm a bit late, I should've put this up on Sunday but I wanted to let the Aggies finish out the Legends Classic. I know that GBH has all the game reviews done, so this is mostly just a piece on the numbers and what they tell us about TAMU basketball.

Quick Notes
-----------

Ranked 16th to start the week. Robert Williams came back against OSU, we still have two more games before JJ Caldwell comes back.

### Starting Five

#### TAMU vs UCSB

**TAMU: Tyler Davis, Tony Trocha-Morales, DJ Hogg, Admon Gilder, Duane Wilson**  
**UCSB: Leland King II, Jalen Canty, Max Heidegger, Christian Terrell, Gabe Vincent**  

#### TAMU vs. OSU

**TAMU: Tyler Davis, Tony Trocha-Morales, DJ Hogg, Admon Gilder, Duane Wilson**  
**OSU: Mitchell Solomon, Lucas N'Guessan, Lindy Waters III, Kendall Smith, Tavarius Shine**  

#### TAMU vs. Penn State

**TAMU: Tyler Davis, Tony Trocha-Morales, DJ Hogg, Admon Gilder, Duane Wilson**   
**PSU: Lamar Stevens, Mike Watkins, Tony Carr, Shep Garner, Josh Reaves**  

Let's get right to it then. Here is the breakdown of the three games.

No issues against UCSB. We broke away from the start. Loving the assist numbers, but it's a bit concerning to not see domination in the rebounding battle. Williams came back for the legends classic, that should make a difference.

Started to pull away after the first 10 minutes of the game. Looks like Williams made a difference and helped us dominate the boards. Surprisingly the assist numbers a bit low here in comparison to previous games. A point of concern, we only shot 9 Free Throws. With the improved FT shooting it would be nice to see an emphasis to go to the line more!

The legends class final was a bit more difficult. We seemed to struggle against the 1-3-1 zone a bit. Both teams got to the line more and thankfully we took care of our free throws. Our assist and rebounding numbers were up.

A slight point of concern is our eagerness to block a lot of shots, and gives the offense more changes for offensive rebounds. Don't believe me? Go look at the OSU game, they out rebounded us on the offensive side. That shouldn't happen and a team like Arizona or Kentucky will make us pay for it.

### Starters vs. Bench

Williams didn't start either game in the Legends Classic, wonder how the spreads will change with him in the starting lineup. Who knows? Kennedy's moves with the starting lineup are going to be huge this year. There's a lot of potential for the second unit to play a big factor, as we are seeing already.

### Assist Maps

I've been playing with these for a bit and finally have a working product that I like. These are the three assist maps for the games this past week.

Arrows heading out are assists by that player, arrows coming in show who scored off the assist. So Gilder was the leading assist man against UCSB, Wilson against OSU and Hogg against PSU. These plots are also nice to see offensive involvement.
