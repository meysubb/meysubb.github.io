Ah, finally college basketball season is upon us. We played in the only top 25 matchup this week. For those of you poor souls still at work on a Friday at 5 pm. I put together a quick overview of how the team looked

Quick Notes
-----------

Robert Williams is suspended for three games. JJ Caldwell is suspended for five games. Not sure if either made the trip, but I didn't see them on TV. On top of that, Hogg and Gilder just returned from suspension.

### Starting Five

**TAMU: Tyler Davis, Tony Trocha-Morales, Savion Flagg, Duane Wilson, Jay-Jay Chandler**
**WVU: Lamont West, Sagaba Konate, Wesley Harris, Jevon Carter, Daxter Miles Jr.**

Let's get right to it then. Here is the breakdown of the game. For a lot of the first half, the Ags were just figuring out how to break the press. Welcome to college basketball freshmen! After that, the Ags didn't really look back. Yep we fell prey to the press on back to back plays only one more time in the second half. WVU cashed in two 3 pointers. But outside of that, it was a strong showing.

We made it to the line a bit more, but contrary to last year and the year before WE CONVERTED FREE THROWS! This is a KEY for us going forward.

It was a remarkable shooting day from 3PT land and generally. Watching the game it seemed like WVU shot the 3 ball better, might just be the style they play that makes you believe that. Just want to harp on one last thing. A team that likes to press can be beaten by superior ball movement and preventing second chances, look at the TAMU assist and rebound numbers!

Note: eFG adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal. For example, suppose Player A goes 4 for 10 with 2 threes, while Player B goes 5 for 10 with 0 threes. Each player would have 10 points from field goals, and thus would have the same effective field goal percentage (50%).

### Starters vs. Bench

This isn't very telling for either team really. You might think oh TAMU's bench really outperformed. I doubt Kennedy keeps both Hogg or Gilder on the bench for long. I expect at least one if not both to start with Caldwell and Williams, when they return from suspension.

### Player Usage

These are both talented teams, and I was kind of curious to see how often a player was involved. Especially with the unexpected starting lineup from Billy Kennedy. Or maybe it was just a disciplinary action.

Anyways, keeping track of player usage rates should become more interesting as we progress through the season.

Definition of Usage Rate: Usage percentage is an estimate of the percentage of team plays used by a player while he was on the floor.
