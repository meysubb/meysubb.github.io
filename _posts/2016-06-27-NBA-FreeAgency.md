I want to introduce you to to some of my good friends who love the NBA just as much as I do, Chai and Rohit. The three of us will take a look at the upcoming NBA Free Agency.

### Dallas Mavericks

Seeing as we are all Dallas Mavs fans, we are all going to take a crack at potential moves for the Mavs. 

With free agency only hours away, the Dallas Mavericks once again find themselves hoping to land a big fish which could propel them in to the conversation being the top 3 teams in the western conference. Dirk is one year older and still the best player on this team last season, no significant draft pick, only one significant role player in Wesley Matthews, and yet there is hope on the horizon.

**Chai** 

Instead of previous years of targeting the one big free agent (Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, Deron Williams, and Chris Paul) to win right away, the Mavericks seem to be learning from those failed endeavors and now have upside to offer to the upcoming free agents: 

* Coach: They’ve got arguably the second best coach in the league in Rick Carlisle, a man who is known to bring out the best in his team, help players achieve results beyond expectations such as Al-Farouq Aminu, Brenden Wright, etc. who have gone on to earn through significant contracts. In terms of role players, Carlisle will find the right guys to surround the stars of the team.

* Owner/GM: Mark Cuban is one of the best in the league in giving his players the best around them, from medical facilities to opening up the checkbook to spend on necessary pieces for a playoff run.

* Dirk: Though an aging superstar, one who is more than happy to let those around him to take the spotlight when necessary and has a type of game which will keep him more than relevant for years to come, especially considering he lead the team in points last season.

* Young core players: Justin Anderson might be the first rookie in the Cuban-Carlisle era who stays with the team and flourishes. He is the ideal 3-and-d type of player which teams covet in free agency and the draft. Combined with a backup center in Salah Mejri, who has been on some top 10 plays for blocking the likes of Russel Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James harden, etc.

With those factors as the leading causes for Dallas to be at the very minimum on the radar for most free agents. The ones to really look closely are those who have mutual interest with the Mavs:

* Mike Conley: It’s no secret that the Mavericks are in need of a starting caliber point guard, who could hold his own in the western conference. Players such as Steph Curry, Chris Paul, Tony parker, Russell Westbrook, and Damien Lillard dominate the West at that position, which is why a premium must be paid to be competitive in that conference. An athletic, high IQ point guard who can also shoulder the scoring when necessary would be ideal for Carlisle’s run and gun offense, one which he hasn’t had since the departure of Jason Kidd. Though a return to Memphis is not out of the question, the well-documented amount of respect that Conley has for Coach Carlisle will be a major factor in his decision regarding Dallas. All the while, Memphis seems to have a new coach, a style of play, which makes them a relic compared to the emerging up-tempo 3 point shooting style of play of the NBA.

* Hassan Whiteside: Seemingly coming out of nowhere before hitting it big with the Miami Heat, Hassan Whiteside is an ideal fit with the Mavericks. He is a big athletic center who can rebound, block shots (as he led the league last season with 3.7 bpg), and an overall defensive presence which dirk can rely on while on defense. He would also wind up next to shooters across the floor which would give him a chance to use his post-game to maneuver down low and not have to worry about defenses swarming him. Unlike the Heat, who have been reported to be low balling him to try to get him to stay at a cheaper rate, the Mavericks are primed to offer him a max deal.

* Nicholas Batum: The rangy big man who can play the 3 or the 4 and even be stretched to the 2 or 5 on limited occasions, would be an excellent replacement for Chandler Parsons. Not only could he play defense really well, he is also a scorer on the other side, he knock down 3-pointers, almost like an upgraded version of Al-Farouq Aminu. When Aminu came to dallas, he was coming off a failed stint with the Pelicans after being drafted in the top 10. If Rick Carlisle can turn him in to an above average role player, it will be exciting to see the potential of Batum in this offense.

Chai will also look at the 76'ers, Pacers, and Celtics. 

**Meyappan** 

Unlike Chai, I have no hope whatsoever in the Dallas Mavericks and their Free Agency shennanigans. This happens year in and year our. I hvae always tried to find a glimpse of hope in the rookies we had from Josh Howard, Beaubois, Crowder, Larkin, and Anderson. Turns out I was really only right about one so far Jae Crowder, and he far exceeded his potential with Brad Stevens. Lets hope the Virginia boys (Carlisle also went to UVA) make some magic happen for the Mavs. I hope we retain Powell as well. 

[REMAINING TBD]

I have decided to look at the Magic, Thunder, and Lakers.
