For those of you that love filling out NCAA brackets. I spent a little time developing an application, that allows you to compare teams in the tournament this year. This application has all of the data for the teams in the tournament and will allow you to cross-compare teams. 

You can compare teams based on multiple different stats, you can look at individual players on a team or compare the team as a whole. 

The application provides data in the form of plots as well as tables. Additionally, I’ve got every team’s schedule (except for games played on 3/13/2016) and a separate tab that has a picture of the current bracket. 

TLDR: Use this application to fill out your NCAA bracket.
