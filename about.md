Hey. I'm Meyappan. I'm a graduate student (Business Analytics) at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas.

Prior to UT, I spent a year at a Department of Energy National Lab (Pacific Northwest National Lab). I received two degrees from Texas A&M, both in Nuclear Engineering (B.S and M.S). GiG'EM!

You'll figure out the rest.
