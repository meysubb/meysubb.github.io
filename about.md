Hey. I'm Meyappan. For those of you that are thinking about where my name is from, its Indian.

So I got both my degrees at Texas A&M. GiG'EM! Both were in Nuclear Engineering (B.S and M.S). I have tons of interests that span from Nuclear related things to sports, international relations, etc. Specifically to nuclear, my interests include Non-proliferation, Security, Safeguards, Arms Control, Power Production, Communicating Nuclear issues, and the use of radiation in medical related topics. For instance, most people don't know this but MRI used to be called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging but people started to freak out and it was modified to MRI. 

In addition to my love for nuclear related concepts, I really love sports, numbers (math and stats) and history. This recent generation of sports viewers are being introduced to analytics. It first started in baseball with Bill James and the Sabermetrics revolution. This past year when applying for jobs, I took some time out to apply for a few sports analytics jobs. With some programming experience and math knowledge, I believed that I was slightly qualified. But never did I actually think I would get a call back from any of these teams. However, not one but two teams called me back to interview. The experience was fantastic, I learnt a lot. From that experience, I realized that I wanted to have a place to showcase my side projects specifically related to sports analytics. So I have put together this website. 

I also hope to use this site as a place to showcase my other various interests such as food and history. Maybe this can also help me improve my writing skills. 

Thanks for checking out my site!
