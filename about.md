Hey. I'm Meyappan. For those of you that are thinking about where my name is from, its Indian.

So I got both my degrees at Texas A&M. GiG'EM! Both were in Nuclear Engineering (B.S and M.S). I have tons of interests that span from Nuclear related things to sports, international relations, etc. Specifically to nuclear, my interests include Non-proliferation, Security, Safeguards, Arms Control, Power Production, Communicating Nuclear issues, and the use of radiation in medical related topics. For instance, most people don't know this but MRI used to be called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging but people started to freak out and it was modified to MRI. 

In addition to my love for nuclear related concepts, I really love sports, numbers (math and stats) and history. This recent generation of sports viewers are being introduced to analytics. It first started in baseball with Bill James and the Sabermetrics revolution. From previous job interview experience, I realized that I wanted to have a place to showcase my side projects specifically related to sports analytics. So I have put together this website. 

Hopefully, I can also show y'all my other various interests such as food and history. Just maybe, let's see if I get around to all of that. 

Ah, so since I told you I love sports here is a list of my favorite teams and players for basically all the sports I watch. I warn you the list is quite extensive. 

For college sports, it is always the Texas A&M Aggies. Regardless of sport, football, basketabll, soccer, tennis, volleyball, etc. Always Gig'Em Ags! Favorite Aggie(s): For football has to be Drew Kaser (yes, a punter for the San Diego Chargers) and Basketball is Khris Middleton. If you haven't had the chance to catch a college sporting event, please take the time to do so. It is something very special and unique. 

Alright so moving on to the professional realm of sports, here are my affilications: Dallas Mavericks (Basketball), Texas Rangers (Baseball), FC Dallas (MLS), Arsenal (EPL), Texas Rangers (MLB), and Dallas Stars (NHL). Mind you I don't watch the MLS or NHL until the playoffs and the EPL when I can. Being on the west coast (and not in school) has made it much harder to watch European soccer. Guess highlights will do for now. 

Favorite Players are Dirk Nowitzki (Dallas/Basketball), Novak Djokovic (Tennis), Jerome Bettis (Football) and Sachin Tendulkar (Cricket). I am Indian, did you expect me to not keep up with the greatest sport on the sub-continent? Come on. 

Thanks for checking out my site!
