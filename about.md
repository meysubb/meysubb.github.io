So you've found my blog! Welcome, I’m Meyappan. I’m a graduate student studying Business Analytics at McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas.

Prior to UT, I spent a year at a Department of Energy National Lab (Pacific Northwest National Lab). I received my Masters and Bachelors in Nuclear Engineering from Texas A&M.

Thanks and GiG’EM!
